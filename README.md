## Ability
* Allows you to Copy (Ctrl+C) Cut (Ctrl+X) Paste (Crtl+V) in Unity project view, aka project explorer window.
* Allows you to do Windows explorer-like navigation, Back (Alt+Left) Forward (Alt+Right) Up one level (Alt+Up) in Unity project view, aka project explorer window.
* **I'm too lazy to record cool gif to demonstrate this, I hope you get the idea.**
## Install
* From Unity, go to Window-> Package manager
* Plus button on upper left (?), choose from git URL (Make sure you have git client installed on your PC)
* Enter https://github.com/wappenull/unity-cutcopypaste-nav.git
* Done, go ahead, and try it.
## Known issue
* Nav feature: is explictly for two-column mode only. CHECKMATE! one-column-er!
* Nav feature: does not offer UI back button, only keyboard shortcut for now.
* Nav feature: Might still buggy, esp when deleting stuff. (please report issue?)
* Not tested against every unity version in the world.
